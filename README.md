GeoHub is a free and open source geography guessing game inspired by Geoguessr.

For those unfamilar with Geoguessr, it uses Google Streetview to place you in a random location and you have to guess where you think you are in the world. You can move around and use clues around you such as Language, Architecture, Road Signs, etc... to make your guess. The objective is clear, the closer you are to the correct location, the more points you get.

## üíú How can I support?

Even though you don't need to pay to play GeoHub, the game still costs money to run and relies on community support to stay running while it grows. If you enjoy playing, please support by donating as all donations will go towards paying for more Google Maps API credits + server costs.

If you still want to help support GeoHub but aren't able to donate, you can also create your own Google Maps API key which gives you $200 USD worth of credit every month. Unless you are playing 24/7 this will be more than enough credits for a single person, meaning you won't have to pay. See the [FAQ](#faq) section for instructions on how to setup your own key.

## ‚ùì FAQ

#### Why are the colors inverted on google maps?

- This means the daily quota for the google maps API has been reached since the game is currently running on the Google Maps free tier. The daily quota resets at midnight Pacific Time (PT). If you want to play unlimited games without hitting the daily quota, see below for how to add/create your own Google Maps API key.

#### How do I add my own Google Maps API key?

- Go to your profile page and click on the settings button on the far right (alternatively you can go to this URL: [Settings](https://www.geohub.gg/user/settings)).
- You then simply paste your key into the `Custom API Key` field and click `Save Changes`. Now all you have to do is refresh the page and enojoy playing as much as you want!

#### How do I create my own Google Maps API key?

- Follow the steps outlined in this [PDF](https://www.geohub.gg/custom-key-instructions.pdf)

#### Will it cost me money to create my own Google Maps API key?

- Short answer: No, it is nearly impossible to exceed the $200 USD credit per month on your own. To put it into perspective, you would have to play atleast 100 games every day of the month to even come close to exceeding the free tier.
- If you are still concerned about getting billed, you can monitor your current billing period usage at any time by going to the Billing page on your Google Cloud account.

## üíª Steps to run locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a Google Maps billing account and save the API key
3. Create a MongoDB database and save the connection string and name of the database you create
4. Create random secrets for NextAuth & Cryptr. On Linux/Windows run the following command in a terminal `openssl rand -base64 32`
5. In the root of the app, create a .env file and add the values below (replacing with your created credentials)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-maps-key"
MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
DB_NAME="your-mongodb-database-name"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="any-random-string"
CRYPTR_SECRET="any-random-string"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Next, you can install the required dependencies and start the local dev server:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

Now, you should be able to see the site running locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üê≥ Docker

You can also easily run the app using Docker and Docker Compose. To do this, first clone the repository. Get your Google Maps API key as explained above. Generate two random secrets for NextAuth and Cryptr with the `openssl rand -base64 32` command. Then, create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-maps-key"
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME="root"
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="example" # Change this to a strong password
DB_NAME="geohub"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-first-random-secret"
CRYPTR_SECRET="your-second-random-secret"
```

Then, run the following command to start the app:
```bash
sudo docker compose up # Add -d flag to run in headless mode
```

Now, you should be able to see the site running locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
